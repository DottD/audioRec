# AudioRec

This is an attempt to develop a software for voice recognition with appealing graphical user interface.

> __Note__: Regretfully, I am not maintaining this software anymore, since it only was a side project of Ph.D.

## Installation

Requirements:

* [Qt5](https://www.qt.io)
* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
* [ALGLIB](https://www.alglib.net)

The software can be installed using `cmake` or `cmake-gui`.

## Tests

Due to the fast development required during the Ph.D. I was not able to generate a suite of tests. Actually, most of the functions need to be thoroughly checked and any good hearted contributor will be welcomed.

## Contributing

Any contribution will be very much appreciated. Feel free to contact me in case of any doubts about contributing.
